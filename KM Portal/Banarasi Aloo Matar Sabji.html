<p>Banarasi aloo matar gravy recipe with step by step photos. A simple punjabi style aloo matar curry which we often make at home. 
    The recipe is an easy<br> home style potato peas curry and not a restaurant style dish.
Simple home style food is usually easier and quick to make. what I specially like<br> about these recipes is that they are made with minimal
 ingredients and yet taste good. they also do not require much cooking expertise. A few more punjabi<br> recipes in this genre.. Aloo gobi, 
 Aloo capsicum, Aloo methi, Aloo baingan and Gajar matar recipe.<br><br>Here is the Recipe of Banarasi Aloo Matar:</p>
