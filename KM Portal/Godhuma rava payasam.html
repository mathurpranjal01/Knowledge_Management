<p>The main ingredients in this particular payasam are cracked wheat aka broken wheat and jaggery. Cracked wheat goes by the name godhuma
    rava in telugu, daliya in hindi, gothumai ravai in tamil and gothambu rava in malayalam. Sweetener of choice is jaggery but sugar can 
    also be used or a combination of both. Vegans can use almond milk or coconut milk. If you have any left over payasam, refrigerate. At 
    the time of serving, add some warm milk, mix over low flame and its as good the day it was prepared. But keep in mind, milk based desserts 
    do not have a long shelf life and its best to refrigerate and eat within 2-3 days of preparation. There are a few variations to cracked
     wheat kheer. I will also blog another version which calls for the addition of yellow moong dal and coconut milk.<br><br>
