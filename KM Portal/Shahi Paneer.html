<p>Shahi Paneer recipe with step by step photos. Shahi Paneer is one of the popular paneer/cottage cheese recipe and also requested by many readers.
    shahi means royal and as the name suggest this is a royal paneer dish. Literally translated to royal cottage cheese. dry fruits, yogurt, saffron, whole spices and sometimes cream is added to make this dish royal and rich. few more similar mughlai recipes posted on the blog are paneer do pyaza, kaju khoya, navratan korma and shahi paneer korma recipe.
    in this recipe, I have not used cream nor i have used butter or ghee. feel free to use cream or butter if you want them.
    The shahi paneer gravy or sauce is onions-almonds-cashew-melon seeds based. So this is very rich with the dry fruits in there, plus there is 
    also yogurt. The result is a creamy, aromatic, semi sweet gravy with soft paneer cubes<br><br>
