<p>A traditional punjabi recipe of missi roti in which i have added methi/fenugreek leaves. You can make missi roti without methi also, but adding these fresh methi leaves, does make the rotis more packed with nutrition and they taste good too.
    I use a lot of greens in the food that i make at home. Some methi or spinach always gets added to pulaos, dal or rotis.
    I am often asked what is the difference between missi roti and thepla. There is not much difference except for the proportion of wheat flour and besan used.thepla is also made with other flours like pearl millet flour (bajra flour) and jowar flour (sorghum flour).
    if living outside india, you may not be able to find fresh fenugreek leaves. In this case, add spinach leaves or add dry fenugreek leaves
     (kasuri methi). proportion mentioned below in the recipe notes.<br><br>
