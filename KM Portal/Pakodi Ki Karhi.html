<p>Punjabi Kadhi recipe with step by step photos. This is my mother in law's recipe of making traditional punjabi kadhi with pakoras. She has been making this kadhi since ages. its a family treasured recipe 
    kadhi is often made at our home, but I just could not manage myself to take step by step photos and thats why it took me so long to share this delicious punjabi kadhi recipe.
    we love kadhis, be it plain or with pakoras. At home we call it Kadhi Chawal, because the kadhi is had with plain rice or jeera rice. you can also have kadhi with roti but i always prefer to have kadhi with rice.
    coming to punjabi recipes, there are a few much loved vegetarian recipes, that I have shared like sarson da saag and makke ki roti, bhatura, 
    punjabi chole,amritsari chole, rajma masala, aloo tikki chole, punjabi garam masala and so many.<br><br>
