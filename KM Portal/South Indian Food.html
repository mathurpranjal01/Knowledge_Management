<h1>South Indian Dishes</h1>
<hr align="left" width="74%">
<p>South Indian cuisine usually encompasses the five Southern states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamilnadu, Telangana, and Kerala.
     Both the geography<br> and cultural influence of the South has an influence on the region's cuisine. As with most countries, there are 
     large regional differences and each state's cuisine<br> can vary greatly even within a specific state. There are typically vegetarian 
     and non-vegetarian dishes for all five states. Additionally, all regions have typical<br> main dishes, snacks, light meals, desserts, 
     and drinks that are well-known in their respective region.<br><br>By and large, South Indian cuisine is perhaps the hottest of all 
     Indian food. Meals are centered around rice or rice-based dishes. Rice is combined with Sambaar<br> (a soup-like lentil dish tempered with 
     whole spices and chilies) and rasam (a hot-sour soup-like lentil dish), dry and curried vegetables, meat dishes, and a<br> host of 
     coconut-based chutneys and poppadums (deep-fried crispy lentil pancakes). South Indians are great lovers of coffee, which is usually a 
     special type <br>made with chicory.<br><br>Click the given item and Read more about them..!</p>
