<p>Dal Bati Churma is a traditional Rajasthani treat.The spicy dal with the sweet churma along with deep fried crunchy batis, its
    such a treat.Few weeks when I was googling saw a dal bati churma picture which tempted me so much that I decided to try it the next day itself.After waving bye to mittu, reached out to a near by store to get the missing ingredients and started it right away.I got an idea of the recipe from my north indian neighbour but for measurements I referred Tarla Dalal.
Right from searching for the recipe to cooking,clicking and plating it, I enjoyed the entire process thoroughly.And how can I forget to 
mention about eating ;) I just love north indian cuisine so much that I had a feast having this dal bati churma as brunch :).I loved to
have churma as such it was soo yum.Do try this heavenly combo and enjoy yourself.Though bati and churma patties recipes are almost similar, 
as given in the orginal recipe I followed 2 different recipes with slight variations.You can use the same bati recipe, deep fry and make churma 
for easy shortcut thats what my neighbour suggested too.She said as its heavy they make only when there is any occassion or special guests 
arrive.<br><br>
