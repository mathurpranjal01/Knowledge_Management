<p>Neer dosa recipe with step by step photos. Thin, fluffy and lacy crepes made with rice batter.
    Neer dosa is yet another variety of dosa from the karnataka cuisine. The word 'neer' translates to 'water' in tulu language, which means
     'water dosa'. These dosas are so called as the batter is watery and not thick like the usual dosa batter.
    Neer dosa was introduced in our family through one of our aunts, who is from thebunt community from mangalore.
     Thereafter we would make these often for morning breakfasts as they are easy to prepare and does not require any fermentation.
      Pair these lacy dosas with some coconut chutney and you have a nice breakfast. They also go well in the tiffin box. These dosas 
      are so light, that you can easily have 5 to 6 of them in one go.<br><br>
