<h1>West Indian Dishes</h1>
<hr align="left" width="74%">
<p>The western region of India includes the following states: Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Goa. Even within these states, 
    the cuisine varies based on<br> the climate, history, and geographic particulars of each region. For example, Rajasthan and Gujarat 
    have hot, dry climates, so the relatively smaller variety<br> of vegetables available are preserved as pickles and chutneys. Goa is 
    a major port known for trade and was a colony of Portugal, so is known for beef,<br> port, and vinegar, which are all Portuguese 
    influenced ingredients.<br><br>This region probably has the most diverse styles of food in India. Rajasthani food is spicy and 
    largely vegetarian but includes many delicious meat dishes like<br> Laal Maas (red meat curry) while Gujaratâ€™s cuisine is known for 
    its slight sweet touch (at least a pinch of sugar is added to most dishes! and is traditionally<br> entirely vegetarian. This area 
    historically had a Chinese influence, which has influenced the sweetness of the cuisine.
