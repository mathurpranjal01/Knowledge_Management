<p>Aloo ka bharta is an Indian style flavored mashed potatoes with a perfect blend of spices, served it several parts of North-India, Bengal 
    and Pakistan also.<br> This is the first time I tried this recipe, I become a fan of this recipe, very easy and tasty dish. You just need boil 
    some potatoes and then saute them with<br> fresh herbs and spices. You can have this dish in your fasting times also.
    In this recipe you can also add some ginger if you want, since this is a no onion<br> no garlic recipe, you can also add a pinch of asafoetida. 
    Serve aloo ka bharta with pooris, parathas or phulkas. You can also serve this as a side dish with<br> dal-chapati like as I have serve in below
 pic. 
Serve Roti with aloo ka bharta, homemade curd, dal and fresh cucumber salad. This is my kind of comfort meal.<br><br>Here is
