<p>Chana Dal Paratha recipe with step by step photos. one more popular paratha made in punjabi homes for breakfast. I have already shared one 
    chana dal methi paratha where the dough is kneaded with leftover chana dal.
    This chana dal paratha is made differently. The chana dal is stuffed in the paratha and then made. Here the chana dal is cooked fresh and 
    then mixed with spices. This filling is stuffed in the paratha.
    The chana dal or bengal gram has to be soaked before and then cooked in pressure cooker. While making the paratha, sometimes the chana dal 
    comes out. Don't worry about that. As the chana dal is already spiced so you will love to eat them like that. Just make sure that you don't 
    use too much chana dal in the stuffing, so that it does not break much.<br><br>
