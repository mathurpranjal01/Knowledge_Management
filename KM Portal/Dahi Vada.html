<p>Dahi vada recipe with step by step photos. Posting a recipe of the north indian dahi vada version. Had made the dahi vadas during diwali 
    time and could not get around to post the recipe then.
    Dahi vada is a popular snack where lentil dumplings are dunked in a creamy whipped yogurt topped with spicy and sweet chutneys.
    Dahi vadas are a craze at home and I do make them at times as the they require some prep work to be done before hands,
    like making both the spicy green coriander chutney and sweet tamarind chutney, preparing the vadas etc<br><br>
    Here is the Recipe of Dahi Vada:</p>
