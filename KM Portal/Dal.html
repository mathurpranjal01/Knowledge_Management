<p>Dal tadka restaurant style recipe with step by step photos. Dal tadka is one of the most popular dal recipe served in indian restaurants.
     Basically, dal tadka are cooked lentils which are lastly tempered with oil or ghee fried spices & herbs.
    I have to admit that i simply love the dal tadka that is served at the restaurants even though we hardly eat out. so i 
    try to recreate the restaurant magic in most of the food that i make at home.

    cooking indian food. In fact we temper almost everything like dal, veggies dishes, chutneys<br><br>
