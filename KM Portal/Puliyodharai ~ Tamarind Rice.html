<p>Puliyodharai is a South Indian rice preparation, a mainstay in most Indian festival luncheons and dinners. It is also 
    offered as prasadams in temples.  Prasadam (a Sanskrit word) is food that has first been offered to God prepared by the
     temple priests in the temple Madapalli (Temple kitchen). Thiru madapalli is traditionally the kitchen in Vaishnavite temples, 
     apart from catering to the divine Lord, these kitchens often serve Prasadams to the devotees.  Madapalli's are famous for Ven pongal , 
     Puliyodharai,  Sarkarai Pongal, Vadai, Laddu, Thayir sadam & Sambar sadam. These are distributed to devotees in either fresh banana
      leaves or dry  banana leaf cups (Thonnai).  My favorite is Perumal Kovil madapalli prasadams, especially their Puliyodharai are very 
      famous for tongue tickling taste! No matter how hard we try, we can never replicate that divine taste in our home kitchens but always 
      wanted to try something which is atleast close to that taste. There are a million versions online but I personally liked the one shared
       by Mrs. Jayashree Govindarajan in her lovely blog My kithcenpitch. She has shared an interesting Temple Style Puliyodharai, it looked
        very authentic and I got instantly hooked!  I tried her version as it is but added puliyodharai powder to the pulikachal mix, it 
        turned out great and matched the temple style puliyodharai.<br><br>
