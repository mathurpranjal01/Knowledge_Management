<p>Mushroom Curry Recipe is an Indian style, very easy to make curry. Sliced mushrooms are in creamy and aromatic gravy, just so delicious.
    Yogurt or curd is used to make this gravy creamy. Make sure to use plain and less sour yogurt to get the best taste of the curry. It stays good for only 2 days otherwise yogurt will become sour.

    gravy. Onions are boiled first then made gravy which gives unique taste to it.<br><br>
