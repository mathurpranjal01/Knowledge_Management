<p>Rajasthani cuisine is perhaps the most sensitive amongst the Indian cuisines. People here relish non-vegetarian dishes made 
    from chicken, lamb and shikar which includes animal and birds like boars, venison, peacock, quail, duck, pheasant, rabbits and even 
    camels etc. Vegetarian food comes in two varieties i.e. the food eaten by the common man that includes use of various spices and herbs 
    and the food of the Marwari Jains that is prepared without using onions, garlic or for that matter any ingredient growing under the 
    soil except for ginger and groundnuts.
Rajasthan cooking in general has its own unique flavour where the simplest and the most basic of ingredients go into the preparation of
 delicious dishes. The harsh climate and the non-availability of ingredients in this region are a great influence.  Food that could last
  for several days and could be eaten without heating was preferred, more out of necessity than choice. The sparse rainfall is not conducive 
  to growing fresh green vegetables. Due to this scarcity whatever seasonal vegetables are grown, are sundried so that they can be used for 
  the rest of the year.<br><br>
