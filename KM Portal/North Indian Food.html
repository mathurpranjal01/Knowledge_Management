<h1>North Indian Dishes</h1>
<hr align="left" width="74.7%">
<p>North India has extreme climates â€“ summers are hot, and winters are cold. The region includes the following states: Jammu & Kashmir,
    Himachal Pradesh,<br> Punjab, Uttaranchal, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh.<br><br>There is an abundance 
    of fresh seasonal fruit and vegetable to be had. Its geographical position with relation to the rest of the Sub-continent means that this<br>
    region of the country has had strong Central Asian influences both in its culture and its food. Mughlai and Kashmiri styles of cooking are 
    not just prevalent;<br> they are also popular.<br><br>North Indian curries usually have thick, moderately spicy and creamy gravies. 
    The use of dried fruits and nuts is fairly common even in everyday foods.<br> Dairy products like milk, cream, cottage cheese, ghee 
    (clarified butter) and yogurt play an important role in the cooking of both savory and sweet dishes.<br> Thanks to the fact that such 
    a rich variety of fruit and vegetable is available at all times of the year, the region produces a dazzling array of vegetarian dishes.
