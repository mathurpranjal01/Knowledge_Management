<p>For those of you who grew up in a South Indian household (especially Tamilian), I don't have to try too hard to sell the idea of 
    Coconut Sevai. It is one<br> of my very favorite ways to have South Indian Rice Noodles. In my previous post, I showed you all how to make
     Rice noodles in the traditional South<br> Indian way. It ain't easy. But this is the only method that gives THE BEST Sevai ever! Once you 
     have your Sevai, you've got to flavor it. Coconut Sevai<br> happens to be the most common Sevai preparation.
Whilst browsing through my friend Roshni's vast recipe collection, I chanced upon this recipe that brought<br> back waves of nostalgia along 
with an instant urge to eat Coconut Sevai!  I did alter the recipe a bit to use up the ingredients that I had on hand. If you do<br> make the 
sevai in the traditional method, kudos to you. However, fret not if you don't have the patience to do it my way. These days, you get Rice<br> 
noodles packs in the store. Just buy one of them, cook according to package instructions and then following the rest of the steps!<br><br>
    Here is the Recipe of Coconut Savai:</p>
