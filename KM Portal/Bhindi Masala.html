<p>Bhindi Masala recipe is easy to make and is a semi dry curry. I have also posted the bhindi masala gravy recipe.
    Bhindi or okra is one favorite veggie at home,<br> after gobi and arbi. All the folks prefer dry or semi dry version of any sabzi with bhindi.
    Most of the recipes that I make at home are easy and simple to<br> make. So is this bhindi recipe.
    Most of the times, I end up making bhindi do pyaaza or my mom's bhindi bhaji. sometimes i also make thebharwan (stuffed)<br> bhindi or the kurkuri bhindi or bhindi aloo.
    like all other dry bhindi recipes, even this bhindi masala is best served with softphulkas or chapatis and a cucumber<br> raita or veg raita by side. they also go well as
    a side dish with some rice-dal or any rice-curry combo.
    I still have to try making bhindi with yogurt. Long time<br> ago i has such a bhindi dish in a restaurant and it was fab. this bhindi 
    masala recipes uses the typical punjabi onion-tomato base with the regular punjabi<br> masalas/spice powders.<br><br>
    Here is the Recipe of Bhindi Masala:</p>
