<p>Khoya Matar Makhana recipe with step by step photos . I have been planning to add this recipe of khoya matar makhana from a long time. But just not able to prepare and post.
    whenever, I would get khoya/mawa from the shops, I would end up adding it in thekulfi or gulab jamun. twice, I added the khoya to make mawa
     cake. in maharashtra and gujarat, evaporated dried milk is known as mawa. in north india evaporated milk is known as khoya and used in
      making many sweets and delicacies.
    This khoya matar makhana recipe is a pretty simple and straightforward punjabi recipe. The way I make my everyday punjabi gravy recipes and sabzis, minus the khoya and cream. another curry recipe where khoya is added is kaju khoya recipe.
    makhana or fox nuts are always there in the kitchen. Usually i roast them and keep in an air tight box. these puffed makhana make for a
     healthy snacking any time of the day. You can also make makhana raita. if you do not have makhana, then simply make the curry with peas 
     and khoya. instead of makhana you can also add paneer/cottage cheese (check recipe notes for details). I also prepare another light & 
     simple version of matar makhana, without the addition of khoya.<br><br>
