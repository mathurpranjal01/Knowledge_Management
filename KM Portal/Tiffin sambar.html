<p>Tiffin Sambar hotel style recipe with step by step photos. One of the best tiffin sambar recipe I must say. The sambar was damn good with the idlis. oh yesï¿½ idli sambar and vada sambar are all time favorite at home. not to forget our love for dosa too.
    well on this day, I just made idli and not dosa. The sambar recipe was shared by a reader friend priya who writes to me often. She was gracious enough to share her sambar recipe as well as this tiffin sambar.
    this tiffin sambar recipe is adapted from revathy shanmugam's recipe and priya was kind enough to translate and send me the recipe. I did make some changes in the recipe though.
    at the first go, I tried and made the recipe and it was so good, that i did get requests for it to make again. Even my house help was so much in 
    awe of the aroma of the sambar masala, that she asked me for the recipe as well as the Sambar Masala Powder<br><br>
    Here is the Recipe of TIffin Sambar:</p>
